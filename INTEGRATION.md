## Integrating Purple HATS with end-to-end testing frameworks
Purple HATS provides functionalities that makes it possible to be integrated with end-to-end testing frameworks such as [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) and [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/).

### Prerequisites
In order to use this functionality, the testing framework must support:
- Execution of scripts in a NodeJS environment.
- Injection of JavaScript into the document that is being tested.
- Execution of JavaScript in the context of the document and retrieval of results back into the NodeJS environment after execution.

### How to include Purple HATS in your project
1. Add Purple HATS to your project by running the following command:

    `npm install --save-dev @govtechsg/purple-hats`
2. In the file of choice, import Purple HATS using:
    
    `import purpleHatsInit from '@govtechsg/purple-hats'`

    Note that Purple HATS should be imported in a script that runs in a NodeJS environment.

3. Create an instance of Purple HATS with:

    `const ph = await purpleHatsInit(entryUrl)`

    `entryUrl` should be a valid URL referring to the domain of the website to be scanned with Purple HATS.

### How to use
Example usages for Cypress and Playwright can be found in [this section](#example-usages).

With reference to an instance of Purple HATS as `ph`:
1. Fetch the necessary scripts needed to be injected to document to be scanned by executing `ph.getScripts()`. The scripts will be returned as a string.
2. Inject the scripts into the document to be scanned. The easiest way that this can be done is by using `eval()` in the document's environment.
    - Note that this step needs to be done for every page visited.
3. Run a scan by executing `runA11yScan()` in the document's environment.
    - By default, the scan will be run for the entire page.
    - It is possible to run the scan for specific sections or elements in the page. One way to do this is to pass an array of CSS selectors of the elements to be scanned into `runA11yScan`. For example, `runA11yScan(['#my-component', 'button'])`. Other acceptable forms of argument can be found [here](https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core/blob/develop/doc/API.md#context-parameter).
4. Pass the scan results back into the NodeJS environment where `ph` is in. 
5. Push the results using `await ph.pushScanResults(scanResults)`.
6. Repeat steps 2-5 as many times as desired.
7. Terminate Purple HATS by using `await ph.terminate()`. A folder containing the details and report of your scan will be created, under the directory `results` which can be found in your project's root directory.

### Example usages
#### Cypress
<details>
<summary>Click here to see an example usage in an E2E Cypress test</summary>
In <code>cypress.config.js</code>:
    
    import { defineConfig } from "cypress";
    import purpleHatsInit from 'purple-hats';

    const ph = await purpleHatsInit("https://govtechsg.github.io");

    export default defineConfig({
    e2e: {
        setupNodeEvents(on, config) {
        on('task', {
            getPhScripts() {
                return ph.getScripts();
            },
            async pushPhScanResults(res) {
                await ph.pushScanResults(res);
                return null;
            },
            async terminatePh() {
                await ph.terminate();
                return null;
            }
        });
        },
    },
    });

In <code>support/commands.js</code>:

    Cypress.Commands.add('injectPhScripts', () => {
        cy.task('getPhScripts').then(s => {
            cy.window().then(win => {
                win.eval(s);
            })
        })
    })

    Cypress.Commands.add('runPhScan', (elements) => {
        cy.window().then(async win => {
            const res = await win.runA11yScan(elements);
            cy.task('pushPhScanResults', res);
        })
    })

    Cypress.Commands.add('terminatePh', () => {
        cy.task('terminatePh')
    })

In <code>e2e/spec.cy.js</code>:
    
    describe("template spec", () => {
        it("passes", () => {
            cy.visit("https://govtechsg.github.io/purple-banner-embeds/purple-integrated-scan-example.htm");
            cy.injectPhScripts();
            cy.runPhScan();
        
            cy.contains('Click Me').click();
            // Run a scan on <input> and <button> elements
            cy.runPhScan(['input', 'button']);
        });
    });

    after(() => {
        cy.terminatePh();
    })

    import { chromium } from 'playwright';
    import purpleHatsInit from 'purple-hats';
